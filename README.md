## Current Status

- the form doesn't do anything (yet...)
- when developing locally, I use `json-server -w database.json -p 8088`, hence the fetch url being local
- I don't have the database API hosted anywhere (obviously, lol)
- if nothing is fetched (i.e. it's deployed somewhere like Vercel), a set of embedded entries are swapped in
